&emsp;&emsp;《源代码》和《罗拉快跑》、《十二怒汉》，采用了相似的拍摄方式，在固定的时间内演绎故事。但是，毫无疑问，他们都经典！
那个男人两次都在同一个女人聊天，为什么差别会这么大呢?

&emsp;&emsp;如果你的生命中，只剩下一分钟，你会选择做什么?你会选择按部就班做现在正在做的事吗?你会吗？

&emsp;&emsp;有一类优秀的电影，就像我今天看到的源代码一样，总是在不断地引导观众的好奇心。为了取得重大突破，证明自己的实验有用。那位博士，总是命令他的思维不断的穿越。他的语气很凌厉，对成功有一种近乎偏执的渴望！而男主对此只有深深地无奈，甩不掉的疲惫感。。。我憎恶这种工具性对待人，非常没有人道精神！在《少年汉尼拔》中，那位死刑犯用绝望的口气说，“我无助时，警察在哪里?＂他是一位纳粹战犯。在战争中 ，一定会有很多战犯逃脱了制裁，并不是每一个人都能被公平的对待！

&emsp;&emsp;“有时候，我得用很长时间，才知道自己最想说的话。”,这是男主对她爸爸说的话，这句话，很温和。有时间，我觉得自己也是这样。2016年9月18日星期日附上情书一封
&emsp;&emsp;如果有一刹那，上帝忘记我是一只布偶并赋予我片刻生命，我可能不会说出我心中的一切所想，但我必定会思考我所说的一切。

　　我会评价事物，按其意义大小而非价值多少。

　　我会少睡觉，多思考。因为我知道，每当我们闭上一分钟眼睛，我们也就同时失去了60秒。当他人停滞时我会前行，当他人入梦时我会清醒，当他人讲话时我会倾听，就像享受一支美味的巧克力冰激凌！

　　如果上帝赏我一段生命，我会简单装束，伏在阳光下，袒露的不仅是身体，还有我的魂灵。

　　上帝呀，如果我有一颗心，我会将仇恨写在冰上，然后期待太阳的升起；我会用凡高的梦在星星上画一首贝内德第的诗，而塞莱特的歌会是将是我献给月亮的小夜曲。我会用泪水浇灌玫瑰，以此体味花刺的痛苦和花瓣的亲吻……

　　上帝呀，如果我有一段生命……我不会放过哪怕是一天，而不对我所爱的人说我爱他们。我会使每个男人和女人都了解他们皆我所爱，我要怀着爱而生活。

　　对于大人，我会向他们证明，那种认为因衰老而失去爱的想法是多么错误，我们是因为失去爱而衰老而不是与之相反。对于孩子，我会给他们插上翅膀而让他们自己学会飞翔；对于老人，我会教给他们死亡的来临不是因为衰老而是因为遗忘。

　　人呀，我从你们身上学会了太多的东西... ...我知道，人们都想伫立在颠峰上，殊不知，真正的幸福恰恰就在于攀登险阻的过程。我懂得，当婴儿用小拳头第一次抓住爸爸的手指时，他也就永远地抓住了它。

　　我明白，一个人只有在帮助他人站起时才有权利俯视他。我能够从你们身上学到的东西是如此之多，可事实上已经意义寥寥，因为当人们将我敛入棺木时，我正在死去。

　　永远说你感到的，做你想到的吧！如果我知道今天是我最后一次看你入睡，我会热烈地拥抱你，祈求上帝守护你的灵魂。如果我知道这是最后一次看你离开家门，我会给你一个拥抱一个吻，然后重新叫住你，再度拥抱亲吻。如果我知道这是最后一次听到你的声音，我会录下你的每个字句，以便可以一遍又一遍永无穷尽地倾听。如果我知道这是看到你的最后几分钟，我会说“我爱你”，而不是傻傻地以为你早已知道。

　　永远有一个明天，生活给我们另一个机会将事情做好，可是如果我搞错了，今天就是我们所剩的全部，我会对你说我多么爱你，我永远不会忘记你。

　　明天从不向任何人作保证，无论青年或老人，今天可能就是你最后一次看到你所爱的人。因此，别再等待了，今天就开始！因为如果明天永远不来，你也许会遗憾今天没来得及微笑，拥抱，亲吻，会遗憾自己忙碌得只能把它们归为一个最后的愿望。保护周围你爱的人吧，告诉他们你多么需要他们。爱他们，善待他们，用些时间对他们说：“对不起”，“原谅我”，“劳驾”，“谢谢”，以及你知道的所有爱的话语。

　　没有人会因为你秘而不宣的思想而记住你。向上帝祈求力量和智慧来表达它们吧，向你的朋友证明，他们对你来说是多么的重要。



&emsp;&emsp;Gabriel Garcia Marquez' Farewell Death Letter to his Friends

La Marioneta by Gabriel Garcia Marquez

 

If for an instance, God should forget

I am only a puppet made of cloth

and bestow as a gift a scrap of life,

I probably could not say all that I think,

but would put thought into all that I say.

 

I would value things not for their worth,

but for their significance.

 

Iwould sleep very little and dream more

with the awareness that every minute

we keep our eyes closed

we lose sixty seconds of Light.

 

I would go forward when the others stagnate.

I would rise up when the others sleep.

I would listen when others talk,

and with how much joy I would taste a good chocolate ice cream!

 

If God bestowed upon me a scrap of life

I would dress in simple clothes

and lay prostrate under the sun

exposing not only my body but my soul.

 

My God, if I had a heart,

I would write my hatred onto a piece of ice

and wait for the sun to appear.

 

With a dream of Van Gogh

I would paint on the stars a poem by Benedetti,

and a song by Serrat would be my serenade to the moon.

 

With my tears I would water the roses,

breathe in the pain of their thorns

and the red kisses of their petals.

 

My God, if I had a scrap of life,

I would not allow one day to pass

without telling a beloved person that I love them.

 

I would convince every man and every woman

that they were my favorites

and I would live a life in love with love.

 

I would prove to the men how mistaken they are

in thinking that they no longer fall in love when they grow old--

not knowing that they grow old when they stop falling in love.

 

To a child I would give wings, but I would let him learn how to fly by himself.

 

To the old I would teach that death comes not with old age

but with forgetting. I have learned so much from you men....

 

I have learned that everybody wants to live

on top of the mountain,

not knowing that true happiness lies in

climbing the mountain.

 

I have learned that when a newborn first squeezes

his father's finger in his tiny fist, he has caught him forever.

 

I have learned that a man has the right

to look down from up high onto another man

only to assist him to stand up again.

 

From you I have learned so many things,

but the truth is that they won't be much use to me

because when they put me into that suitcase

it will unfortunately be to die.

 

Always say what you feel

and do what you think.

 

If I knew that today was the last time

I could watch you falling asleep

I would hug you and

pray to God to allow me to be the

guardian of your soul.

 

If I knew that today was the last time

that I saw you walking through that door

I would hug you, kiss you and call upon you

to do so even more.

 

If I knew that today was the last time

that I could hear your voice

I would register every single word

in order to hear them over and over again.

 

If I knew that these were the last minutes

that I'd see you I would say 'I love you'

and would not care if I overwhelmed you one bit

by the fact that you already knew.

 

There is always a tomorrow

and life gives us another possibility

to do things right

 

but if I got this wrong and today was all there is left,

I would take delight in telling you

how much I love you,

that I will never forget you.

 

Tomorrow cannot be insured

by anybody, young or old.

 

Today can be your last time

to see somebody you love.

 

Therefore, don't wait for more.

 

Do it today.

 

Because if tomorrow wasn't going to arrive

you would surely regret the day where you did not

have time for a smile, a hug, a kiss

and that you were too busy to fulfill a last wish.

 

Hold who you love close to you,

tell them how much you need them,

love them and treat them well.

 

Find the time to tell them 'I'm sorry',

'forgiveme', 'please', 'thankyou'

and all the words of love that you know.

 

No one will remember your secret thoughts.

Ask the Lord to give you the strength

and the wisdom to express them.

 

Show your friends and beloved ones

that they are important.

 

Send this to whoever you want.

 

If you don't do it today,

tomorrow will be the same as yesterday.

 

And if you won't ever do it, it won't matter.

 

The moment is now.

 
With love
